  <!-- Comments in HTML follow this convention, and cloding

  <!-- in order to display line spaces, the <br> is used-->
  <!-- in order to generate a line in the document, the <hr> or horizontal line is used  with also whatever option is selected-->
  <hr size="10" align="left" noshade>
  <!-- <center>  </center> are also used to center text in a page, with different ways to arrange the possition-->
  <center>Metadata and other information declared inside these, corresponds to information related to the website and what can be found from the outside, for example the description of a website (which is obtained by google to describe the content of
    it in the preview of the website)</center>
  To use bolding or italisize something is better to use <em>em</em> instead of using <i>i</i>, because it provides not only format, but also strucure, and the second is to use <strong>strong</strong> instead of <b>b</b>, because it provides
  structure.
  The option <p>paragraph treats all the content of it as a single paragraph.</p>
  To create line spaces you can use <br>br <br> in order to create line enter.
  In order to insert an order list you use the unordered list or the ordered list.
  The ul for unordered lists and ol for ordered lists, being the elements inside of them defined by the li or list item. All of this elements need an opening and a closure.
  <em><strong>For example</em></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>first</li>
    <li>second</li>
    <li>third</li>
  </ul>
  <ol type="A" start="15">
    <li>bullet</li>
    <li>bullet</li>
    <li>bullet</li>
  </ol>
  In order to insert an image, you can either add the location of the image or the image itself. To do it, you add img src="" where you adde within the quotes, the image address. src="address" alt="text explaning the image" The alt option is for
  alternative text that provides a description of the image to any searching site that encounters the image.
  <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/414612/pexels-photo-414612.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500" alt="Picture of sunset">

  <p> A hyperlink uses the convention <a href="#"> a href="location of the file"</a>, needning an openning and closing tag </p>

  <!-- Tables are created by defining their atribute as a table, and then defining the fields inside of it, being them the section headings or thead, containing the th or table heads, its section body or tbody, confaining table rows or tr, table fields or td (or table data) and footers tfoot.

<p>Also, a nested table can be used in order to </p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <h3>Skill</h3>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>HTML</td>
          <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐&#x2605
          <td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <h3>Skill</h3>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>HTML</td>
          <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐&#x2605
          <td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<hr>
In order to provide some spacing in the table, we use cellspacing
<table cellspacing=50>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h3>Skill</h3>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>⭐⭐⭐⭐&#x2605</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JAVAL</td>
    <td>⭐⭐&#x2605</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We can also create forms in order to provide communication between the website and other stuff:


<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
  <label>Your name</label>
  <input type="text" name="" value="">
<input type="color" name="" value="Color">
<input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
  <input type="submit" name="" value="Submit">
</form>

</body>

</html>
